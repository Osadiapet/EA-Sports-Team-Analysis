## EA Sports Teams  Analysis

**Introduction**

In this analysis, we leveraged the EA Sports dataset spanning from 2014 to 2024 for FIFA games. Our goal was to harness data science and analytics to uncover valuable insights from this rich dataset. We explored various aspects of the data to better understand team performance, attribute relationships, and trends over the years.

**Key Objectives**

Identifying Best-Performing Teams: We sought to determine which teams consistently exhibited the highest average overall rating, effectively identifying the best-performing teams over time.

- Analyzing Attribute Relationships: We explored how different team attributes relate to each other, unveiling hidden connections and dependencies among the attributes.

- Distribution Analysis: Examining attribute distributions allowed us to gain insights into the data's inherent patterns, highlighting central tendencies and variabilities.

- Yearly Team Performance Trends: To assess the progress of teams over time, we analyzed the trend of overall scores on a yearly basis, providing a comprehensive view of performance changes.

- Top Teams in Key Attributes: We conducted an analysis to identify the top teams in critical attributes, shedding light on which teams excelled in specific aspects.

- League Analysis: We explored the top leagues, assessing their overall scores and identifying those with the youngest and oldest squads.

- Attributes vs. Overall Score: An essential part of our analysis was investigating how team attributes correlate with the overall team score, providing valuable insights into what makes a team successful.

**Limitations**

It is important to acknowledge certain limitations of this analysis and the dataset:

- Missing Data: A significant number of missing values in various columns restricted our ability to perform extensive statistical modeling and testing. This posed a challenge in obtaining a holistic view of the dataset, as null values hindered precise analysis.

Despite these limitations, our analysis still offers valuable insights into the FIFA games dataset, shedding light on team performance and the relationships between attributes. We hope this analysis serves as a valuable resource for enthusiasts, researchers, and data science enthusiasts interested in the world of FIFA games
